                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoblade_Chronicles" target="_blank" title="index">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> is a series of action role-playing games developed by <u>Monolith Soft</u> and published by <u>
                Nintendo</u>. The series began with the original Xenoblade Chronicles game, published for the Nintendo Wii in 2010. 
                Though initially only released in Japan, it was localized into other regions as a result of Operation Rainfall, 
                a large grass-roots fan campaign to pressure Nintendo to localize several Japan-exclusive games. 
                The original game became a critical and commercial success, spawning multiple sequels. The series has since sold more 
                than 8.2 million copies worldwide. Xenoblade Chronicles has been well-received for its world design, music, stories, and themes. 
                The series has been represented in other gaming franchises, including the Super Smash Bros. and Project X Zone series. 
                It is loosely a part of the Xeno metaseries, for which it receives its namesake, co-created and directed by <strong>Tetsuya Takahashi.</strong>
